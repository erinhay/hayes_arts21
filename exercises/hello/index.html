            <p>&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; is frequently the first phrase used when learning a new programming language. When programmers see this word on a screen, it means that their code worked, indicating a success. As an introduction to our class, create a gif that will serve as your &ldquo;hello world.&rdquo;</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Since I already had my &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; moment at the beginning of the pandemic, when I first got more interested in web development, I wanted to focus on the aspects of the exterrnal world I have been experiencing more with the change in lifestyle due to the pandemic. Over this period, I have been biking more and exploring different areas of Philadelphia, PA; Phoenixville, PA; and Ocean City, NJ. The photos in the GIF are of my newly (and not so newly) discovered happy places.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Furthermore, much like a looping GIF, we just have to keep moving, even during difficult times.</p>
