            <p>Hi, and welcome to my final portfolio!</p>
            <br>
            <p>My name is Erin Hayes and I am a junior at the University of Pennsylvania studying physics, with a concentration in astrophysics, and minors in design and math. In addition to the BA, I will be submatriculating and recieving my MS in physics. On campus, I am a Vagelos Scholar and a member of Arts House Dance Company, West Philly Tutoring Project, Women in Physics, Penn Astronomical Student Association, and the Annenberg Center Student Advisory Council. I also serve as the Chair of the Dance Arts Council. Lastly, I work in the Department of Physics & Astronomy under Masao Sako as a research assistant.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I'm not studying, I enjoy attending the ballet and the orchestra, wandering through art museums, playing the piano and the guitar, checking cities off of my travel bucket list, cooking very involved meals, or just curling up with a good book and a cup of tea. I am always looking for ways to engage with art, whether that be directly by creating through music, dance, or design, or indirectly by reading, watching, or listening.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In DSGN 234: Art of the Web, I have enjoyed refining my HTML/CSS skills, exploring my design process and interests, and playing with both artistic and practical perspectives on web design. Looking back to a year ago, when I first became interested in website development, I am amazed at how much I have grown in all of these respects, thanks to Nika Simovich Fischer and my peers in the class.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most of all, I am appreciative of how this class has strengthened the connection between art and science for me. Of course, I find scientific subject matter interesting, but the connection is more meaningful for me in a behind-the-scenes sense. What I believe to be my most successful projects have all felt very researched in terms of content, design, typography, and so on. It is when I have thoroughly explored my design choices, much like one would approach research questions, that I am able to create thoughtful work. When I am purposeful in my designs, I feel the most proud.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am beyond excited to see where the skills I have learned from this class will take me next.</p>
            <br>
            <p>xoxo</p>
