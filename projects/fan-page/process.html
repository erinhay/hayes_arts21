        <div class="text">
            <p>On a weekend trip to the beach with friends, I discovered sunscreen was an incredibly polarizing topic of conversation. Some friends felt very passionately about the importance of wearing sunscreen, some saw it as a necessary evil, some thought it was good but rarely wore it, and some didn&rsquo;t think it was worth wearing at all. The range of reactions to a product I assumed everyone saw the benefits of inspired me to make a fan page for sunscreen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I gathered much of my content from text conversations with friends. I wanted to explore how fact and opininon interacted to create responses in people through my website. Furthermore, I wanted it to expose the real truth of the importance of sunscreen.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>The landing page of the site is meant to mimic the front of a sunscreen bottle. It is for that reason that SPF is in big, bold text in the center of the screen. I wanted to abstrract that idea a little, though, which is why I went with wavy features at the bottom. Beyond the obvious beach associations, I associate the shape of sunscreen bottles with waves. The bottle&rsquo;s drug facts are located on the bottom right corner of the page. Clicking on &rdquo;drug facts&ldquo; is almost like flipping over the bottle.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When you land on the drug facts page, you see a very conventional and familiar looking layout. Clicking into each tab, though, reveals a mess of information related to sunscreen. The juxtaposition between the neat exterior and personal, messy, in-your-face interior is meant to echo the difference between the knowledge that sunscreen is good and the public&rsquo;s varying response to it. I chose to go with the default sans-serif for the entire site. As a font, it is able to be fun, opinionated, straightforward, informative, and playful, depending on context. Not to mention it is a relatively block-y font, which fits the sun block theme.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The content, as was mentioned, was gathered mostly from text conversations, but I also did some of my own research to support and dispute some of the things I heard from my friends. As I discuss in my reflection, I&rsquo;m not sure the content is particularly effective in communicating a cohesive story. It is an ecletic mix of things, which I find enjoyable to discover, but I think it could have been more curated to communicate a clearer message to the user.</p>

        <br>
        <div class="text">
            <p>This project was the most difficult for me this semester and I'm still not entirely pleased with how it turned out. I feel my strongest work this semester was when I was very conscious of my choice of type, content, etc. Those decisions really got away from me with this fan page project, and I stil haven't been able to pinpoint why. A major factor in that was not being able to figure out what story I wanted to tell about sunscreen, beyond wear it, and that shows.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Right now, the information on the site is a bit difficult to access. I wanted to juxtapose opinions on sunscreen with facts about it, but I think this could have been achieved in a different way. I think there's something to the more personal nature of the tabs hidden in the conventional &rdquo;Drug Facts&ldquo; design, but I think the text in the tabs could be made smaller and the headers of each section could be made sticky to make the user experience better.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The landing page could also use some work. Supposed to mimic the front of a sunscreen bottle, it doesn't really acheieve that effect. It was more of an afterthought, so I should consider more actively how to make it clear that you are &rdquo;flipping over&ldquo; the bottle to the drug facts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That said, I did still have a lot of fun with my sunscreen fan page. Mostly because the process of gathering content from friends was really entertaining. Texting people I hadn't spoken to in months about their thoughts on sunscreen yielded some really fun conversations. I earned myself the reputation of having a weirdly strong interest in SPF and that is quite a fun thing by which I wil remember this project.</p>
