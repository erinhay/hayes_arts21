        <div class="text">
            <p>I am very happy with the final version of this project! I had a strong sense of what I wanted the site to look like from the beginning of the project, making the challenge translating it to code. The coding took a few tries to figure out, and is still a little finicky on occassions, but I felt realy accomplished when I was able to create the effect I wanted to with code. As such, the type, content, organization, and so on felt like it fell naturally into place with this project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I think the landing page could be made easier to use by making the button to enter the page larger. I am also not entirely in love with the way the black hole pushes the text to the outskirts of the page towards the end of the site â€“ the text gets squished in too few steps. I didn't end up using hover effects on the text, but I wonder if that would help make the interaction of the text with the black hole more intuitive.</p>
