        <h1><a href="1.html">THE FIRST MERGER OF TWO BLACK HOLES WAS DETECTED BY THE LASER INTERFEROMETER GRAVITATIONAL WAVE OBSERVATORY (LIGO) IN 2015. WHEN THE TWO BLACK HOLES COLLIDED, THEY RELEASED WAVES OF ENERGY THAT STRETCHED SPACE-TIME, DISTORTING OUR MEASUREMENTS OF LENGTH ON EARTH. FOR LESS THAN A SECOND, EVERYTHING ON EARTH WAS A TINY BIT TALLER, THEN A TINY BIT SHORTER BEFORE RETURNING TO THEIR “NORMAL” HEIGHT. ALBERT EINSTEIN PREDICTED THAT THESE SO-CALLED “GRAVITY WAVES” EXISTED, BUT DID NOT THINK HUMANS WOULD EVER DEVELOP SENSITIVE ENOUGH TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT THEM. HE WAS WRONG ABOUT ONE OF THOSE THINGS. LIGO IS CALIBRATED TO DETECT A STRETCH OR SHRINK OF SPACE-TIME OF LESS THAN A THOUSANDTH OF THE WIDTH OF A SINGLE PROTON. ONLY THE MOST VIOLENT AND EXPLOSIVE EVENTS IN OUR UNIVERSE PRODUCE GRAVITY WAVES STRONG ENOUGH TO YIELD A SIGNAL ON  THIS  SCALE.</a></h1>
