        Probably. Black holes are mysterious objects predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity. They are the remains of massive stars that have collapsed under the force of their own gravity, generating gravitational fields so strong that not even light can escape. Astronomers have discovered quite a few objects that can only be explained as black holes. But of course, because we can never see a black hole directly, it’s impossible to know with absolute certainty that they really exist. All we know is that our theories of physics predict that black holes should exist, and that there are objects out there in space that exhibit every characteristic we would expect black holes to have. These objects are so dark, dense, and heavy that they must be either black holes or something even more exotic.
