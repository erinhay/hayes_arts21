        <h1><a href="1.html">"Astronomers have discovered quite a few objects that can only be explained as black holes. These objects are dark, so we cannot see them, but they exert a powerful influence on the stars, gas, and even space around them. These objects are so dark, dense, and heavy that they must be either black holes or something even more exotic." -StarDate. "Scientists can't directly observe black holes with telescopes that detect x-rays, light, or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. We can, however, infer the presence of black holes and study them by detecting their effect on other matter nearby." - NASA. "But of course, because we can never see a black hole directly, itâ€™s impossible to know with absolute certainty that they really exist." -</a></h1>
